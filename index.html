<p>The regulatory function in healthcare industries is vital in making safe and effective healthcare products available worldwide. Individuals who ensure regulatory compliance and prepare submissions, as well as those whose main job function is clinical affairs or quality assurance are all considered regulatory professionals. The most significant responsibility of a Regulatory professional in an export company is to get a product successfully registered and approved by the Health Agency of the country like FDA for USA or EMA for Europe.</p>
<p>Regulatory professionals are employed in industry, government and academia and are involved with a wide range of products, including:</p>

<ul>
<li>pharmaceuticals</li>
<li>medical devices</li>
<li>in vitro diagnostics</li>
<li>biologics and biotechnology</li>
<li>nutritional products</li>
<li>cosmetics</li>
<li>veterinary products</li>

</ul>

<p>The regulatory professional's roles and responsibilities often begin in the research and development phases, moving into clinical trials and extending through premarket approvals, manufacturing, labeling and advertising and postmarket surveillance</p>




<!-- Core competencies -->

<h2 id="core-competencies" >Core competencies</h2>

<p>Regulatory professionals come from diverse backgrounds. Most regulatory professionals have earned a bachelor's degree, and more than half have an advanced degree, most often in a scientific or technical field. In addition, regulatory professionals usually have experience in other careers before transitioning into regulatory affairs.
  Although there are some university degree and graduate certificate programs in regulatory affairs and related areas, experience is a key asset for regulatory professionals. Valuable skills include project management and organization, negotiation and communication, and the ability to learn from the experience of others, both inside and outside the organization.
  Continuing education and professional development are critical to the regulatory professional. Regulatory professionals must keep up to date with regulatory policies and procedures for one or more countries, as well as maintain an understanding of the scientific and technical background of healthcare products. Global aspects of regulatory affairs are taken up by organisations such as the Drug Information Association (DIA) and the International Conference on Harmonisation of Technical Requirements for Registration of Pharmaceuticals for Human Use (ICH).
